# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
# ethsafari-hackathon

The project contains frontend in next js and backend to be done in solidity 
hardhat is the framework
.env for private keys 
We will use quicknode rpc and sepolia or mumbai testnets for this project
To run frontend cd into frontend and run npm run dev
Smart Contracts: You could use smart contracts to create a decentralized marketplace where farmers and consumers can buy and sell produce. The smart contracts could be used to ensure that the prices of produce are stable and that both farmers and consumers are protected in case of any emergencies.

Futures Contracts: You could use futures contracts to allow consumers to buy produce at a predetermined price in the future. This would help to stabilize food prices and give farmers a guaranteed income.

Insurance: You could partner with an insurance company to provide insurance for farmers and consumers. This would protect them from financial losses in case of crop failure, bad weather, or other unforeseen events.

Here is a possible workflow for your project:

Consumers use futures contracts to buy produce from farmers at a predetermined price in the future.
Farmers use the money from the futures contracts to finance their production costs.
Farmers plant and harvest their crops.
Consumers receive their produce at the predetermined price.
If there are any problems with the crops, the insurance company compensates the farmers and consumers for their losses.
Smart contracts could be used to automate all of the steps in this process, making it more efficient and transparent. For example, the smart contracts could be used to:

Ensure that consumers only pay for produce that is actually delivered to them.
Compensate farmers and consumers for any losses that they incur due to crop failure, bad weather, or other unforeseen events.
Distribute the proceeds from the futures contracts to the farmers.
Futures contract: This contract would allow consumers to buy produce from farmers at a predetermined price in the future. The contract would specify the type and quantity of produce, the delivery date, and the price.
Insurance contract: This contract would protect farmers and consumers from financial losses in case of crop failure, bad weather, or other unforeseen events. The contract would specify the types of losses that are covered, the amount of coverage, and the deductible.
Marketplace contract: This contract would facilitate the buying and selling of produce between farmers and consumers. The contract would specify the terms of the sale, such as the price, the delivery method, and the payment terms.
